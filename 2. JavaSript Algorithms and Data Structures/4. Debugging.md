## Debugging
Debugging is the process of going through your code, finding any issues, and fixing them.

Issues in code generally come in three forms: syntax errors that prevent your program from running, runtime errors where your code has unexpected behavior, or logical errors where your code doesn't do what you intended.

In this course, you'll learn how to use the JavaScript console to debug programs and prevent common issues before they happen.

### Use the JavaScript Console to Check the Value of a Variable
### Understanding the Differences between the freeCodeCamp and Browser Console
### Use typeof to Check the Type of a Variable
### Catch Misspelled Variable and Function Names
### Catch Unclosed Parentheses, Brackets, Braces and Quotes
### Catch Mixed Usage of Single and Double Quotes
### Catch Use of Assignment Operator Instead of Equality Operator
### Catch Missing Open and Closing Parenthesis After a Function Call
### Catch Arguments Passed in the Wrong Order When Calling a Function
### Catch Off By One Errors When Using Indexing
### Use Caution When Reinitializing Variables Inside a Loop
### Prevent Infinite Loops with a Valid Terminal Condition

### Basic Data Structures
Data can be stored and accessed in many ways. You already know some common JavaScript data structures â€” arrays and objects.

In this Basic Data Structures course, you'll learn more about the differences between arrays and objects, and which to use in different situations. You'll also learn how to use helpful JS methods like `splice()` and `Object.keys()` to access and manipulate data

### Use an Array to Store a Collection of Data
### Access an Array's Contents Using Bracket Notation
### Add Items to an Array with push() and unshift()
### Remove Items from an Array with pop() and shift()
### Remove Items Using splice()
### Add Items Using splice()
### Copy Array Items Using slice()
### Copy an Array with the Spread Operator
### Combine Arrays with the Spread Operator
### Check For The Presence of an Element With indexOf()
### Iterate Through All an Array's Items Using For Loops
### Create complex multi-dimensional arrays
### Add Key-Value Pairs to JavaScript Objects
### Modify an Object Nested Within an Object
### Access Property Names with Bracket Notation
### Use the delete Keyword to Remove Object Properties
### Check if an Object has a Property
### Iterate Through the Keys of an Object with a for...in Statement
### Generate an Array of All Object Keys with Object.keys()
### Modify an Array Stored in an Object
